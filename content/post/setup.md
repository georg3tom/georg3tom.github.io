I'm currently running arch with bspwm. I spent more time than I care to admit setting up the perfect work environment. I figure if I'm gonna stare at this thing for hours on end, it might as well be a work of art. You can find my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/georg3tom/dotfiles). 

## Installation  

Setting up on a fresh system is pretty easy since the dotfiles are managed using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/georg3tom/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
stow HOME
```
